## ðŸ”’ **Security & Data Integrity**

### **Primary Keys**
- All tables use UUID primary keys for security
- No sequential IDs that could be guessed

### **Foreign Key Constraints**
- All relationships enforced at database level
- Cascading deletes where appropriate
- Referential integrity maintained

### **Unique Constraints**
- Email addresses must be unique across users
- Phone numbers must be unique across contacts
- Category names must be unique

### **Data Validation**
- Email format validation
- Phone number format validation
- Enum constraints for predefined values
- JSON validation for complex data structures

### **Audit Trail**
- All tables have `createdAt` and `updatedAt` timestamps
- User actions tracked through foreign key relationships
- Complete history of changes maintained

## ðŸ“Š **Performance Considerations**

### **Indexing Strategy**
- Primary keys automatically indexed
- Foreign keys indexed for join performance
- Unique constraints create indexes
- Search fields (name, email, phone) indexed

### **Query Optimization**
- Proper foreign key relationships for efficient joins
- Pagination support for large datasets
- Selective field loading to reduce data transfer

### **Scalability Features**
- UUID primary keys support distributed systems
- JSON fields for flexible data storage
- Normalized structure reduces data redundancy
