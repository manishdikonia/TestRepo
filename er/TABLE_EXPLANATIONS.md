# üìö Complete Table Explanations - LMS Database

## üîê **AUTHENTICATION & RBAC SECTION**

### 1. **`roles`** - System Roles Definition
**Purpose:** Defines all available roles in the system (global, not company-specific)

```sql
roles {
  role_id integer [PK]           -- Unique role identifier
  role_name varchar(50)          -- "Admin", "Coach", "HR Manager", "Employee"
  description text               -- What this role can do
  is_system_role boolean         -- System roles cannot be deleted
  created_at timestamp
  updated_at timestamp
}
```

**Examples:**
- Admin: Full system access
- Coach: Can manage batches and assessments
- HR Manager: Can manage employees and view reports
- Employee: Can take assessments and view resources

---

### 2. **`permissions`** - System Permissions
**Purpose:** Defines what actions can be performed on what resources

```sql
permissions {
  permission_id integer [PK]     -- Unique permission ID
  permission_name varchar(100)   -- "create_batch", "view_reports", "edit_user"
  description text               -- What this permission allows
  resource varchar(50)           -- "batch", "user", "assessment", "report"
  action varchar(20)             -- "create", "read", "update", "delete"
  created_at timestamp
}
```

**Examples:**
- create_batch: Can create new training batches
- view_assessment_results: Can see assessment outcomes
- manage_users: Can add/edit/remove users

---

### 3. **`role_permissions`** - Links Roles to Permissions
**Purpose:** Junction table that assigns permissions to roles

```sql
role_permissions {
  role_id integer [FK ‚Üí roles]        -- Which role
  permission_id integer [FK ‚Üí permissions]  -- Gets which permission
  assigned_at timestamp                -- When permission was granted
}
```

**Example:** Admin role gets ALL permissions, Coach role gets only batch and assessment permissions

---

## üè¢ **ORGANIZATION MANAGEMENT SECTION**

### 4. **`companies`** - Client Organizations
**Purpose:** Multi-tenant system - each company is a separate client

```sql
companies {
  company_id integer [PK]        -- Unique company identifier
  company_name varchar(200)      -- "TechCorp Inc", "Healthcare Solutions"
  contact_person varchar(100)    -- Primary contact name
  contact_email varchar(100)     -- Business email
  contact_phone varchar(20)      -- Business phone
  address text                   -- Company address
  contract_start_date date       -- When service started
  contract_end_date date         -- When contract expires
  max_batch_size integer         -- Maximum learners per batch
  max_employees integer          -- Maximum employees allowed
  subscription_status enum       -- ACTIVE, INACTIVE, SUSPENDED
  created_at timestamp
  updated_at timestamp
}
```

**Business Logic:** Controls licensing limits and access for each client organization

---

### 5. **`users`** - All System Users
**Purpose:** Everyone who uses the system (employees, coaches, admins)

```sql
users {
  user_id integer [PK]           -- Unique user identifier
  company_id integer [FK ‚Üí companies]  -- Which company they belong to
  role_id integer [FK ‚Üí roles]   -- Their system role
  name varchar(100)              -- Full name

  is_active boolean              -- Can they log in?
  last_login timestamp           -- When they last accessed system
  created_by integer [FK ‚Üí users]  -- Who created this user
  created_at timestamp
  updated_at timestamp
}
```

**Key Relationships:**
- Belongs to one company
- Has one system role (with permissions)
- Can be created by another user (audit trail)

---

### 6. **`company_coaches`** - External Coaches Assignment
**Purpose:** Links external coaches to companies (many-to-many relationship)

```sql

  assigned_at timestamp                -- When assignment started
  assigned_by integer [FK ‚Üí users]     -- Who made the assignment
  is_active boolean                    -- Is assignment currently active?
}
```

**Business Logic:** A coach can work with multiple companies, and a company can have multiple coaches

---

## üìö **LEARNING & ASSESSMENTS SECTION**

}
```

**Business Logic:** Core learning unit - everything revolves around batches

---

### 8. **`batch_participants`** - Who's in Each Batch
**Purpose:** Links users to batches (many-to-many relationship)

```sql
batch_participants {
  batch_id integer [FK ‚Üí batches]      -- Which batch

  enrolled_at timestamp                -- When they joined
  enrolled_by integer [FK ‚Üí users]     -- Who enrolled them
  status enum                          -- ACTIVE, COMPLETED, DROPPED
}
```

**Business Logic:** Tracks who is taking what training and their progress status

---

### 9. **`assessment_tools`** - Types of Assessments

---

### 11. **`assessments`** - Individual Assessment Records
**Purpose:** Records of actual assessments taken by users or candidates

```sql
assessments {
  assessment_id integer [PK]     -- Unique assessment record

- Results can be edited during freeze period
- After freeze period, results are locked

---

### 12. **`assignments`** - Learning Assignments
**Purpose:** Tasks/projects that are part of assessment tools

```sql

**Business Logic:** Controls who can access what learning materials

---

### 15. **`batch_resource_access`** - Resource Permissions per Batch
**Purpose:** Controls which resources are available to which batches

```sql
batch_resource_access {
  batch_id integer [FK ‚Üí batches]    -- Which batch
  resource_id integer [FK ‚Üí resources]  -- Gets access to which resource
  unlocked_by integer [FK ‚Üí users]   -- Who granted access
  unlocked_at timestamp              -- When access was granted
  access_expires_at timestamp        -- When access expires (optional)

2. **Assessment assigned** ‚Üí Uses `assessment_packages`
3. **Candidate takes assessment** ‚Üí Record in `assessments` (with candidate_id)
4. **If hired** ‚Üí Converted to `users` record

This system supports a complete learning and assessment ecosystem! üéØ
