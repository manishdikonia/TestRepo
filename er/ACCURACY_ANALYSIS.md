# ER Diagram Accuracy Analysis

## üö® **Potential Issues Found**

### 1. **Assessment Logic Issue** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Problem:** The `assessments` table has BOTH `user_id` AND `candidate_id` foreign keys, but they should be mutually exclusive.

```sql
-- Current (Problematic):
assessments {
  user_id integer [ref: > users.user_id]           -- For employees
  candidate_id integer [ref: > interview_candidates.candidate_id] -- For candidates
}
```

**Fix Needed:** These should be nullable and mutually exclusive, or use a polymorphic relationship.

### 2. **Missing Constraints** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Problem:** No check constraints to ensure data integrity:
- Assessment should have EITHER user_id OR candidate_id, not both
- Package usage tracking may go negative
- Date validations missing (start_date < end_date)

### 3. **Incomplete Workflow Support** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Problem:** Missing tables/fields for complete LMS workflow:
- No **course/curriculum** structure
- No **learning paths** or **prerequisites**  
- No **notifications** system
- No **progress tracking** beyond assessments
- No **certificates** or **achievements**

### 4. **Assessment Package Logic** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Problem:** Package consumption tracking might be flawed:
```sql
assessment_packages {
  total_assessments integer [not null]
  used_assessments integer [default: 0]
  remaining_assessments integer  -- This should be calculated, not stored
}
```

### 5. **Role-Based Access Gaps** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Problem:** RBAC system exists but might be incomplete:
- No **company-specific roles** (roles seem global)
- No **resource-level permissions**
- Missing **batch-level access controls**

### 6. **Quiz System Limitations** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Problem:** Quiz system seems disconnected:
- No link between quizzes and batches/courses
- No quiz assignment to specific users
- Missing quiz attempt limits
- No quiz grading/scoring rules

### 7. **Resource Access Model** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Problem:** Resource access is only batch-based:
- No individual user resource access
- No role-based resource access
- Missing resource versioning

## ‚úÖ **What's Done Well**

1. **Multi-tenancy** - Good company isolation
2. **Audit trails** - Created/updated timestamps
3. **Flexible assessment tools** - Good abstraction
4. **Coach assignment** - Proper many-to-many relationship
5. **Assignment submissions** - Complete workflow

## üîß **Recommended Fixes**

### Priority 1 (Critical):
1. Fix assessment user/candidate logic
2. Add check constraints for data integrity
3. Make remaining_assessments calculated field

### Priority 2 (Important):
1. Add course/curriculum structure
2. Implement proper resource access controls
3. Connect quiz system to learning paths

### Priority 3 (Enhancement):
1. Add notification system
2. Add progress tracking
3. Add certificates/achievements

## ü§î **Questions for Client Validation**

1. **Assessment Model:** Should employees and candidates use the same assessment table?
2. **Learning Structure:** Do you need courses/curricula beyond just batches?
3. **Resource Access:** Should resources be accessible individually or only through batches?
4. **Quiz Integration:** Should quizzes be part of formal learning paths?
5. **Progress Tracking:** What level of learning progress detail is needed?
6. **Notifications:** Is an integrated notification system required?

## üìä **Accuracy Rating: 7/10**

**Strengths:** Good foundation, proper relationships, multi-tenant design
**Weaknesses:** Some business logic flaws, missing workflow components

The schema provides a solid foundation but needs refinement for production use.
