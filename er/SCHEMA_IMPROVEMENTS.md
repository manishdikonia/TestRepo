# Database Schema Improvements

## Problems with Original Schema

The original database schema diagram was messy and difficult to understand due to:

1. **No logical organization** - Tables were scattered without clear groupings
2. **Poor visual layout** - Overlapping connections and cramped design
3. **Missing structure** - No clear hierarchy or flow between related components
4. **Difficult to navigate** - Hard to understand the system architecture at a glance

## Improvements Made

### 1. Logical Grouping
Organized tables into clear functional groups:

- **🔐 Authentication & RBAC** - roles, permissions, role_permissions
- **🏢 Organization Management** - companies, users, company_coaches
- **📚 Learning & Assessments** - batches, batch_participants, assessment_tools, assessment_packages, assessments, assignments, assignment_submissions
- **📁 Content & Access** - resources, batch_resource_access
- **👥 Interview Candidates** - interview_candidates
- **❓ Quizzes** - quizzes, quiz_sessions, quiz_responses
- **⚙️ System Settings** - system_settings

### 2. Clear Section Headers
Added descriptive section headers with visual separators to make the schema self-documenting.

### 3. Better Formatting
- Consistent indentation and spacing
- Clear comments and documentation
- Logical ordering of tables within each section

### 4. Improved Relationships
- Grouped relationships by functional area
- Clear, descriptive relationship names
- Better organization of foreign key relationships
