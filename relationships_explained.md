# üîó Database Relationships & Uses Explained

## üìå What are Relationships?

Think of relationships like **connections between different lists**. 

**Simple Example:**
- You have a list of STUDENTS
- You have a list of CLASSES
- The relationship tells us "which student is in which class"

## üéØ Types of Relationships

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **One-to-One (1:1)**
**Meaning:** One thing connects to exactly one other thing

**Example in your system:**
```
USERS ‚Üê‚Üí PARTICIPANTS
One login account = One employee profile
```

**Real-world example:** 
- One person = One passport
- One car = One license plate

**Use:** When you need to split information but keep it connected
- USERS table: login info (email, password)
- PARTICIPANTS table: employee details (department, designation)

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **One-to-Many (1:N)**
**Meaning:** One thing connects to many things

**Example in your system:**
```
COMPANIES ‚Üí PARTICIPANTS
One company has many employees
```

**Real-world example:**
- One mother ‚Üí Many children
- One teacher ‚Üí Many students
- One company ‚Üí Many employees

**Use:** When one parent has multiple children
- One COMPANY has many EMPLOYEES
- One BATCH has many PARTICIPANTS
- One ASSESSMENT_TOOL used for many ASSESSMENTS

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Many-to-Many (N:N)**
**Meaning:** Many things connect to many other things

**Example in your system:**
```
COACHES ‚Üê‚Üí COMPANIES (through COACH_COMPANIES table)
Many coaches can work with many companies
```

**Real-world example:**
- Students ‚Üê‚Üí Subjects (students take many subjects, subjects have many students)
- Actors ‚Üê‚Üí Movies (actors in many movies, movies have many actors)

**Use:** When both sides can have multiple connections
- Coaches teach at multiple companies
- Companies hire multiple coaches

## üìä Key Relationships in Your System

### üîµ **USER MANAGEMENT RELATIONSHIPS**

```
USERS (Main Login Table)
    ‚Üì
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PARTICIPANTS (1:1) - If user is employee
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ COACHES (1:1) - If user is trainer  
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ADMINS (1:1) - If user is admin
```

**Why this design?**
- Everyone logs in through ONE system (USERS)
- But different roles need different information
- Keeps login separate from role-specific data

**How it's used:**
```sql
When John logs in:
1. Check USERS table (email/password)
2. Find role_type = "participant"
3. Get details from PARTICIPANTS table
4. Show employee dashboard
```

---

### üü¢ **TRAINING BATCH RELATIONSHIPS**

```
COMPANIES
    ‚Üì (1:N)
BATCHES
    ‚Üì (1:N)
BATCH_PARTICIPANTS
    ‚Üë (N:1)
PARTICIPANTS
```

**Real Use Case:**
```
TechCorp (COMPANY)
    ‚Üí Creates "January-2024-Batch" (BATCHES)
    ‚Üí Adds 25 employees (BATCH_PARTICIPANTS)
    ‚Üí Each employee is a PARTICIPANT
```

**Why separate BATCH_PARTICIPANTS table?**
- Tracks WHO is in WHICH batch
- Stores enrollment date
- Tracks individual progress
- Allows moving employees between batches

---

### üü† **ASSESSMENT RELATIONSHIPS**

```
ASSESSMENT_TOOLS (The test template)
    ‚Üì (1:N)
ASSESSMENTS (When someone takes the test)
    ‚Üì (1:1)
ASSESSMENT_RESULTS (The scores)
```

**How it works:**
```
1. ASSESSMENT_TOOLS: "Leadership Test" template
2. John takes it ‚Üí Creates ASSESSMENT record
3. Scores stored ‚Üí ASSESSMENT_RESULTS
   - calculated_result: 75% (computer)
   - final_result: 78% (coach adjusted)
```

**Why two results?**
- Computer gives automatic score
- Human coach can adjust if needed
- Both are saved for transparency

---

### üü£ **RESOURCE ACCESS RELATIONSHIPS**

```
RESOURCES (PDFs, Documents)
    ‚Üì
BATCH_RESOURCES (Who can access what)
    ‚Üë
BATCHES (Which group)
```

**Real Example:**
```
"Leadership-Guide.pdf" (RESOURCES)
    ‚Üí Linked to "Batch-A" (BATCH_RESOURCES)
    ‚Üí Coach unlocks on Day 3
    ‚Üí All Batch-A students can now view
    ‚Üí But cannot download (view only!)
```

---

## üí° Practical Examples of Relationships

### Example 1: "Show all employees of TechCorp"
```
COMPANIES table
    ‚Üì (company_id)
PARTICIPANTS table (WHERE company_id = TechCorp's ID)
```

### Example 2: "Find John's test results"
```
USERS (John's login)
    ‚Üì (user_id)
PARTICIPANTS (John's employee profile)
    ‚Üì (participant_id)
ASSESSMENTS (All tests John took)
    ‚Üì (assessment_id)
ASSESSMENT_RESULTS (John's scores)
```

### Example 3: "Which coach teaches Batch-A?"
```
BATCHES (Batch-A)
    ‚Üì (coach_id)
COACHES (Coach details)
    ‚Üì (user_id)
USERS (Coach's name and email)
```

## üîë Foreign Keys Explained

**What is a Foreign Key (FK)?**
- It's like a "pointer" to another table
- Links records together

**Example:**
```
PARTICIPANTS table has:
- participant_id (PK) = Own ID
- user_id (FK) = Points to USERS table
- company_id (FK) = Points to COMPANIES table
- batch_id (FK) = Points to BATCHES table
```

**Visual Example:**
```
John's record:
participant_id: 101 (his unique ID)
user_id: 5 ‚Üí Points to USERS table record #5
company_id: 3 ‚Üí Points to TechCorp in COMPANIES
batch_id: 7 ‚Üí Points to "Batch-A" in BATCHES
```

---

## üéØ Why These Relationships Matter

### 1. **Data Integrity**
- Can't have employee without company
- Can't have assessment without participant
- Can't have result without assessment

### 2. **No Duplication**
- Company info stored once, used many times
- User login stored once, linked to role

### 3. **Easy Updates**
- Change company name in one place
- Updates everywhere automatically

### 4. **Flexible Queries**
- "Show all employees in Batch-A"
- "Find all assessments taken by TechCorp employees"
- "List coaches teaching in January"

## üìä Common Relationship Patterns

### **Parent-Child Pattern**
```
COMPANY (Parent)
    ‚Üì
EMPLOYEES (Children)
```
- Delete company = Delete all employees
- One company, many employees

### **Junction Table Pattern**
```
COACHES ‚Üê‚Üí COACH_COMPANIES ‚Üê‚Üí COMPANIES
```
- Handles many-to-many relationships
- Stores additional info (assignment date)

### **Status Tracking Pattern**
```
ASSESSMENTS ‚Üí ASSESSMENT_RESULTS
```
- Main record (assessment taken)
- Status record (scores, frozen status)

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

**Relationships help us:**
1. **Connect** related information
2. **Avoid** data duplication  
3. **Maintain** data consistency
4. **Query** complex information easily
5. **Scale** the system efficiently

**Remember:**
- **1:1** = One-to-one (unique pairs)
- **1:N** = One-to-many (parent with children)
- **N:N** = Many-to-many (multiple connections)
- **FK** = Foreign Key (pointer to another table)
- **PK** = Primary Key (unique identifier)

The relationships make your database smart - it knows how everything connects together!
